GetKDE.org is an alternative to KDE.org.

Let's make a better vehicle to spread the word of KDE.

A little history: the original KDE.org redesign began a long time ago, but
essentially it was a redesigned frame with just the existing text copied back
into the frame without any real design consideration. The KDE-www war project
was started to raise awareness about how to think design first, art second. In
response, the KDE-www team started up the neverland project. Due to lack of
progress and fundamental flaws (eg: objective to move away from Oxygen), this
has been forked to use the original work from the KDE-www war and turn it into
GetKDE.org

Objectives:
1) Replicate all the functionality in an improved manner from KDE.org
2) Align with KDE branding, including:
 a) Visual branding, Oxygen, Air, Plasma
 b) Promotional branding, KDE is a community
 c) Jargon branding, Applications, Workspaces, Infrastructure
3) Serve as an introductory hub to the three aspects of KDE:
 a) Explore how KDE can benefit you
 b) Connect to the KDE community
 c) Contribute to KDE
4) Raise design and brand awareness for other KDE developers
